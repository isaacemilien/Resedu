                <p>Using this week’s resources an understanding of how to implement external and embedded CSS , select elements, share styles, and apply further page styling was gained.</p>
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>CSS is a markup language that stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to customise the presentation of HTML. [5]</p>
                <h3>External and Embedded CSS</h3>
                <p>External and embedded CSS refers to how styles are linked to a page. External CSS are styles held in a separate file, saved as .css. Internal CSS is applied within a HTML file using the style element.</p>
                <h3>Implementations</h3>
                <p>While CSS was previously used on the site to add styles, and solve particular problems that were occurring with default HTML elements, the normalisation page had not yet been implemented. After creating the normalisation.css file however it had no effect on the styles, later it was realised that even though the normalisation file was created, it had not been referenced in the index file.</p>

                <h3>Section and Div Elements</h3>
                <p>Section and div elements are used to define logical collections of information on the page. Sections more so encompass typical page specific content such as headers, footers, and navigation. Div elements define looser general divisions of content.</p>
                <h3>Document Navigation</h3>
                <p>Document navigation is achieved using anchors and links. Anchors are defined using the <a> tag; anchors hold links which connect to another page, or page area.</p>
                <h3>Implementations</h3>
                <p>A table was added containing information about university lectures and labs. After adding the table the overall look was not satisfactory; to further style it a blogpost from Anna Fitzgerald was referenced [4, allowing for change of colour and text style using CSS></p>

                <p>This week learning covered the basics of HTML which included: tags and elements, block and inline elements, and natural document structure. Furthermore, newly learned elements were implemented.</p>
                <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
                <p>Tags and elements are keywords in HTML when applied to text define their meaning [2].  Elements are the function itself,  tags define bounds of an element.</p>
                <h3>Block and Inline Elements</h3>
                <p>HTML block and inline are two types of element. Block elements naturally stack horizontally and fill a page row, examples include h1, and p. Inline elements are held inside block elements and can be used to perform a function on them.</p>
                <h3>Natural Document Structure</h3>
                <p>HTML documents naturally follow a nested structure enabling:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Placement of elements within or below one another</li>
                    <li>Logical placement of content on page</li>

                <p>This week's lectures covered the fundamentals of web development. This covers responsive web design, standards, and reasoning behind HTML and CSS rules. Further knowledge gained about these were:</p>
                <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                <p>Responsive design is the adjusting of website scaling based on the device screen. Meaning that the content can be seen on a large variety of devices.</p>
                <p>While learning this topic there was difficulty understanding how basic responsive design worked, from reading [1] interaction-design.org’s article and new understanding  that responsive design is implemented based first on by reading the width of  a user's device to gauge how to size elements.</p>
                <h3>Web Standards</h3>
                <p>Web standards are a set of rules for displaying information on the web. Web standards allow for information to be shown in a similar way on different platforms.</p>
